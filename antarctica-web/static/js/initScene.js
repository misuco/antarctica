Fly a spaceship in BabylonJS - Part 3

Barbara the Bee spaceship model comes from Quaternius' Ultimate Space Kit:

For this scene, we need to load two BabylonJS scripts:

 * Babylon.js Core - the core runtime
 * Babylon.js All Official Loaders (OBJ, STL, glTF) - because we're loading a GLTF

The BabylonJS scripts are loaded from CDN, though we use jsdelivr rather than BabylonJS' own CDN because jsdelivr allows us to lock to a specific version.

See here for details on loading BabylonJS scripts:

const sunLight = new DirectionalLight("sun light", new Vector3(1, -1, -1));

// Bind to the window's resize DOM event, so that we can update the <canvas> dimensions to match;
// this is needed because the <canvas> render context doesn't automaticaly update itself
const onWindowResize = () => {
  canvas.width = canvas.clientWidth;
  canvas.height = canvas.clientHeight;
};
// You can see the problem if you disable this next line, and then resize the window - the scene will become pixelated
window.addEventListener("resize", onWindowResize);
